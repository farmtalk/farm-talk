            <h2>What is Farm Talk?</h2>
            <p>
                Farm Talk is an online platform that connects farmers, companies, and consumers in one seamless marketplace. 
                Our goal is to make it easier for farmers to sell their crops, for companies to source fresh produce, 
                and for consumers to buy directly from local growers. We aim to create a community that supports sustainable 
                agriculture and boosts local economies.
